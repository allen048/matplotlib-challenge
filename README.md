•	Module 5 Challenge Analysis:

o	Summary:  This challenge was broken down into several tasks to display data from the mouse_metadata.csv and study_results.csv files.   These files have been used to create various charts and graphs to analyze the information for mice who have been diagnosed with squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), a form of skin cancer. We will be using data visualization to understand the qualitative and quantitative data gathered from the tumor development of the mice.

o	Prepare the data: The source data has been compiled into two csv files, mouse_metadata and study_results. They are DataFrames that have been organized into a single DataFrame using Jupyter Notebook. One of the objectives was to find each distinct mouse. I used python code to complete these exercises.

o	Generate Summary Statistics: This assignment involved calculating the summary statistics for each drug regimen for the mice used in this study. The mean, median, variance, standard deviation, and SEM for the tumor volume is displayed in a DataFrame for each treatment.

o	Create Bar Charts and Pie Charts: In this study, it required creating two bar charts with similar data. One involved creating a DataFrame using Pandas and the other required using Matplotlib to visually display the data for each method. The data consists of drug regimens and their counts. Also, it involved creating two pie charts using the same methods that was needed to create the bar charts. This displayed the distribution of males vs. females for this analysis.

o	Calculate Quartiles, Find Outliers, and Create a Box Plot: The quartiles are a distribution of the four equal regimens, which is Capomulin, Ramicane, Infubinol, and Ceftamin. There does seem to be outliers in this group of treatments. The box plot shows that there are some commonalities in these treatments at a minimum.

o	Create a Line Plot and a Scatter Plot: I selected mouse b128 for this task. The line plot showed a decrease in tumor volume as the time point increase. The scatter plot showed values (tumor volume) for each individual data point (time point).

o	Correlation and Regression: In dealing with correlation, the relationship between the mouse weight and average tumor volume for Capomulin produced a value of 0.84. This is a good relationship for these variables. The linear regression shows the relationship between two variables. In this observation, we’re determining the valued relationship between mouse weight and average tumor volume.
